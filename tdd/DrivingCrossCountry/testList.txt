//Acceptance Test List: be prepared to execute automated tests (of any kind) that prove that you can do each of these

Run an entire simulated trip from origin to destination, reporting total miles traversed and duration, in days and hours. 

Run an entire simulated trip in a way that reports origins and destinations of each leg as you go, with durations of the legs, and 
durations of stopovers. 






//Isolation Test List: be prepared to prove that you can do each of these:

//DONE Can create new Trip
//DONE Can add Place to Trip
//DONE Can add second Place to Trip

//DONE Can retrieve total number of Places in Trip


//TODO Can retrieve Place from Trip by cityname
//TODO Can get duration from last Place to this Place using getTimeFromLastPlace(). 
//TODO Can get cost of driving from one Place to next Place somehow. 
//TODO Total drive time, quickstop time, and stopover time (total time spent) per day  must be less than 24 hours. 
//TODO You must track total duration and money spent during the trip. 


//TODO Can get from Baltimore to Charlottesville

//TODO Can retrieve total number of Places in Trip
//TODO Can traverse Trip fully, asserting for each Place that you are at the correct place
//TODO Can remove Place from Trip, including reference to that Place 
//TODO Can create Origin (kind of Place) = Baltimore
//TODO Can create Destination (kind of Place) = Destination
//TODO Neither Origin nor Destination can be removed from Trip
//TODO
